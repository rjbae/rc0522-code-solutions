User can sign up:
- User starts on home page.
- Clicks on either "Sign Up" in navbar or "Register now" in the form.
- Client re-renders to the sign up page.
- User then enters a username and password.
- Once submitted, a network request is sent with fetch.
- Server receives a POST request
- Server checks if username or password field is empty.
- Throws an error if either one is.
- If no errors occur, then the password is hashed.
- After hashing, the username and password get stored in the database.
- The database then returns the "userId", "username", and "createdAt" values
- Page then re-renders into the Sign In page by changing the hash route value

User can sign in:
- User starts on home page
- Enters the username and password they signed up with
- Client sends a network request with fetch once the user submits their info
- Server receives a POST request
- Checks to see if the username or password field is empty, then throws an error if true.
- If both fields are filled, then the database is searched for a matching username.
- If there is not a matching username then the an error is thrown.
- The server then verifies to see if the username matches with the password.
- If they do not match, then an error is thrown.
- If both the username and password match, a response is sent to the client.
- Once the response is received, the client stores the token into local storage and re-renders the page.
- The setState method is called and the user in state is set to the user object received by the server.
- Client then renders the home page.

User can stay signed in (even if they refresh the page):
- User can stay signed in since the local storage already has user's token from when they signed in.
- If a token is present then the home page is rendered to have a user be rick rolled.
- If a token is not present then the page is redirected to the sign-in page.

User can sign out:
- User clicks on sign out in the top right corner of the navbar
- User's token gets removed from local storage.
- Home page re-renders and get redirected to the sign-in page.
